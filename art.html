	   Nature provides the ultimate scenery for any beginner to begin.</br> It's simplicity is easily imagined by a child and handful of things</br> like trees, flowers, river and mountains find their</br> place on the sheet of white paper. Even trained artists imagine</br> themselves in nature and paint various paintings with a subtle</br> sense of their own invention of beauty of environment.</br> Even after that it doesn't have any significant place in </br>peoples' live. That's why nature is suffering due to ignorance</br> of general people.

    Their is a diversification in beauty of Indian Art as it has gone through various ruling periods of</br> different cultures. Most of its art form can be seen in architecture of monuments,</br> sculptures of temples and unique skill of embroidery of rural people. Art was not something just to showcase</br> the skill, but it was a part of the life for various people in history. Art in the form</br> of wall painting was highly encouraged to represent the beauty of nature and praja(general public) of kingdom.</br> People portray Gods through various art forms to worship something that could represent their diety.</br> The crafts of India are diverse, rich in history and religion. The craft of each state in India reflect </br>the influence of different empires. Throughout centuries, crafts have been embedded</br> as a culture and tradition within rural communities. Gujarat, Rajasthan,</br> South India and North Eastern States give refugee to history of Indian Art and rural people are</br> trying to preserve the art by passing on the skills to the</br> generations hence. The art of India really showcase the beauty </br>of happiness in its simplicity and one great example of 'RANN OF KUTCH' can be given.

      Gond art is a form of tribal art developed by the Gonds of central India. This art has been inspired by the hills, streams and forests in which the Gonds live. Nature and social customs are depicted by the Gond artists with a series of dots and dashes intricately arranged into forms. Gond paintings are made on walls, ceilings and floors of village houses in honour of customs and festivals. The Gonds also believe that their paintings are infused with a luck factor.The paintings are a combination of earth tones and vibrant hues, which bring the canvas to life. The technique of Gond art can be traced back to the old art of tattooing which is common among the Gonds. The paintings began with an attempt to record folklore and tribal stories sung by wandering poets and singers. Capturing stories in art has been a common practice in India.

	 ‘Patta’ indicates ‘vastra’ or clothing, and ‘chitra’ means painting. This special painting on cloth is a special art form of Orissa. To make the canvas, the painters use fine gauze-like cloth, which they fortify with tamarind paste, chalk powder and gum. After drying the canvas, the pattachitra painters draw the most intricate designs on it and color it with natural dyes. The pattachitra paintings adorn the stories of the epic Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and those of the local deity Lord Jagannath.
     Pattachitra can be dated back to the 5th century BC. It is an art form developed lovingly by the locals of Raghurajpur, Puri, Sonepur, etc. The appearance of the paintings became more widespread with the construction of the great temples of Puri, Konark and Bhubaneswar. A plethora of paintings appeared in temples and maths around the 18th century, and the pattastyle of painting pattachitra developed with the setting up of the Jagannath temple.

     As the name suggests, miniature paintings refer to paint works that are small in size but capture great detail of subject and expression in the work. In India, miniature paintings form a broad category, including an abundance of Mughal miniature paintings that depict the court life and the contemporary personalities, events and actions of the Mughal times. The main characteristic of the miniature paintings is the intricate brushwork and the vibrant colours made from semi-precious stones, conch shells, gold and silver. Developed during the Mughal Period (16th – 19th century), Indian miniature paintings have a touch of Persian miniature. Though miniature paintings developed in the Mughal courts, the style was adopted by the Hindus (Rajputs) and later the Sikhs. Mughal miniatures flourished under the reign of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.

	 Southern Tamil Nadu is famous for its Tanjore paintings. An art form that flourished in Tanjore in the yester years, the painting style is still popular and widely learnt. The paintings are made with semi-precious stones, glass and gold. They look very beautiful and add a touch of grandeur to their surroundings. The characters of these paintings are mainly gods and goddesses with large round faces and embellished designs. This art form flourished around 16th to 18th century in Tanjore under the Cholas and was patronized by the princes, Nayaks, Naidus and developed as a scared art. The popularity of this art coincided with a time, when magnificent temples were being built by various rulers and hence, the subject revolved around the divine.

     Like the Patachitra in Orissa, the indigenous art form that developed in Bengal came to be known as Bengal Pat. Paintings are made with dyes made from spices, earth, soot, etc. and reflect the life and times of the society and folklore. The traditional colors used in Bengal Pat are red, indigo, green, black and ochre. Bengal Pat has a very interesting angle to it. Some paintings depict spoofs on retrograde social practices, thus attempting to highlight them for change. This art form of Bengal developed hundreds of years back when roaming minstrels used to sing about incidents of the distant past and popular lore to villagers. Some of these artists started depicting these stories on cloth scrolls for preservation and beautification.

	 The folk painting of Bihar is known as Madhubani painting or Maithili painting, names taken from the regions of origin, namely, Madhuban and Mithila. The paintings are developed on various geometrical designs and the characters are portrayed with large soulful eyes and a colorful environment. Stories from the mythologies are depicted in these paintings and Lord Krishna is a favorite subject. Origin and history of Madhubani or Maithili painting cannot be traced. Mithila is believed to be the kingdom of King Janak, the father of Sita. The art that prevailed at the time of Ramayana in Mithila may have developed down the ages into Maithili art. The age-old tradition of wall paintings in Bihar had a significant role to play in the development of this art form.

     This style of painting has got its name from the method of craftsmanship – ‘kalam’ meaning pen and ‘kari’ meaning work. The artists use fine pens made of bamboo dipped in vegetable dyes to draw. Drawings are made up of fine lines and intricate designs. This style of painting was developed in Kalahasti near Chennai and Masulipatnam near Hyderabad. Kalahasti kalamkari developed near temples and therefore has mythological theme. Some Kalamkari paintings show touches of Persian influence in motifs and design. Kalamkari painting flourished during the Maratha rule and developed a style called the Karuppur. It’s a work on fabric which is enhanced with gold brocade for the royal families.

      Phad painting is usually done on Khadi fabric. Most popular themes also include scenes from everyday rural life, the daily life of artisans and farmers, animals and birds and so on. This form of folk art painting uses natural earthen colors mixed with water, gum and indigo, in a certain measure, to get the required colors. These paintings use various shades of the same color to arrive at the desired effect. The main themes of the Phad paintings depict major Hindu deities and their legends, as also tales of maharajas and their kingdoms. The colors employed are generally vegetable dyes and are used in a fixed order starting from orange-yellow to brown, bold greens and blues, red and black. The effect this creates, gives the onlooker a feeling of transcending time and actually entering the realm of the story being narrated through the means of the canvas.

     Kalighat painting used many strong social themes and focused on creating awareness in society. This folk art is the first of its kind in the Indian subcontinent that expressed subaltered sentiment. Kalighat paintings started with religious undertones too, just like all other forms of Indian folk art painting. Hindu deities, such as Durga, Kali, Ram-Sita, Rukmini-Krishna and so on, featured in most of the initial paintings. With time, social sentiments came to be expressed. The wealthy landowners ravishing wine and women, sloppy babus spending their day and night at questionable locales, a priest or Vaishnav "Guru" living with unchaste women - these were some of the themes depicted by the artists. They had a moralizing intent and would draw the caricatures in such a way as would repel ordinary people from such activities. The Babus' slavery to these women also subtly depicted the then changing face and eroding values of Indian society.

	 The Warlis form part of a Scheduled Tribe in India. These people stick by a set of their own beliefs, customs and traditions and also speak an unwritten Varli language. The most popular theme of this ritual painting heritage revolves around fishing and farming; festivals and social functions; types of dances and trees and animals. Additional themes, such as men and women gathering around a bonfire on a cold night, shepherds accompanying sheep in the fields and so on, are also depicted in Warli art. Human and animal bodies are represented in the form of stick figures, by way of two triangles joined at the tip; the upper triangle depicting the trunk and the lower triangle, the pelvis. This kind of approach, surprisingly depicting equilibrium, symbolizes the balance of the universe.The wall paintings are done only during special occasions such as harvests, weddings and births.

	  Mehndi is a ceremonial art form which originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent. It is typically applied during weddings - most often for brides but sometimes for grooms. Women use mehndi for other festive occasions, such as religious events and traditional ceremonies. Mehndi is a Vedic custom, intended to be a symbolic representation of the outer and the inner sun. Vedic customs are centered on the idea of "awakening the inner light". Traditional Indian designs are representations of the sun on the palm which is intended to represent the hands and feet.

   <h2>Art in Trouble</h2>
   <p>There are many more art forms which remain unexplored but have a significance in some sense.</br> Having such an immense beauty and beautiful meaning, still they all are under</br> threat of losing their importance and getting extinct. Craftsmen and artists </br>doesn't have any global name and don't get enough incentives to raise their ability to</br>showcase their unique talent. We think that thinqart is gonna be the platform </br>through which the people can get those incentives and educate the young talent</br> to let the art thrive.
