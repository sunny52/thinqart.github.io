   <p style="font-size:20px; color:#800000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:30px; font-weight:bold;">
    Indian classical dance is an umbrella term for various codified art forms rooted in sacred Hindu musical</br> theatre styles whose theory can be traced back to the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni. Classical dance in India</br> has developed a type of dance-drama that is a form of a total theater. The dancer acts out a story almost</br> exclusively through gestures. Most of the classical dances enact stories from Hindu mythology. Each form </br>represents the culture and ethos of a particular region or a group of people. Kathak from North India,</br> Manipuri from the North Eastern corner, Odissi from Orissa, Kuchipudi from Andhra Pradesh, Bharatanatyam</br> from Tamil Nadu and Kathakali and Mohiniattam from Kerala are some of the present day classical dance</br> styles of India. Seeing the beauty, grace and the seemingly different styles of today one can only</br> imagine how magnificent the dance of the bygone times would have been.

   <p style="color:#800000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    The name Bharata Natyam is of relatively recent origin when performers like Rukmini Devi revived the dance in the 20th century.</br> Lord Shiva in his Nataraja form is considered the God of this dance. In Kali Yuga, the center of most arts in India is Bhakti (devotion)</br> and therefore, Bharata Natyam as a dance form and carnatic music set to it are deeply grounded in Bhakti.Bharata Natyam proper is a</br> solo dance, with two aspects, lasya, the graceful feminine lines and movements, and tandava Ananda Thandavam (Tamil)</br> (the dance of Shiva), masculine aspect. Bharata Natyam, it is said, is the embodiment of music in visual form, a ceremony, and an act</br> of devotion. Dance and music are inseparable forms; only with Sangeetam (words or syllables set to raga or melody) can dance be</br> conceptualized. Bharata Natyam has three distinct elements to it: Nritta (rhythmic dance movements), Natya (mime, or dance with</br> a dramatic aspect), and Nritya (combination of Nritta and Natya). "Natya" portrays a character and "Nritya" can be seen as a type </br>of story telling, using lots of hand gestures and emotions. The movements of an authentic Bharata Natyam dancer resemble the </br>movements of a dancing flame. Contemporary Bharata Natyam is rarely practiced as Natya Yoga, a sacred meditational tradition. This</br> type of dance requires the dancer's imagination and initiative to tell a story through dancing and music.There are 4 types of abhinaya </br>in dance. They are Anghika - Physical or body movements; Vachika - the song being played, poetry; Aaharya - Ornamentation of</br> a character/dancer e.g. jewellery, costume; Satvika - Involuntary movements e.g. trembling, break of voice, tears. The Abhinaya </br>Darpana, one of the two most authoritative texts on Bharata Natyam, has a sloka that describes Patra Prana Dasha Smrutaha</br> — the ten essentials of the dancer: Javaha (agility), Sthirathvam (steadiness), Rekha (graceful lines), Bhramari (balance in pirouettes),</br> Drishti (glance), Shramaha (hard work), Medha (intelligence), Shraddha (devotion), Vacho (good speech), and Geetam (singing).

   <p style="color:#99003d; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Kathak is one of the eight forms of Indian classical dance. This dance form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient</br> northern India, known as Kathakars or storytellers. Its form today contains traces of temple and ritual dances, and the influence</br> of the bhakti movement. The name kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word katha meaning "story", and katthaka in Sanskrit</br> means "he who tells a story". These poets, performing in village squares and temple courtyards, mostly specialized in recounting </br>mythological and moral tales from the scriptures. They use to perform those stories with hand gestures and facial expressions.</br> It was a high class theatre, using instrumental and vocal music along with stylized gestures, to telling the stories. The technique of</br> Kathak is easy to understand by fast rhythmic footwork set to complex time cycles. The footwork is matched by the accompanying</br> percussion instruments such as tabla and pakhawaj, and the dancer and percussionists often play with speed and ending in </br>statuesque poses. During the era of fervent worship of Radha-Krishna, Kathak was used to narrate tales from the lives of</br> these figures. Popular performances included Sri Krishna’s exploits in the holy land of Vrindavan, and tales of Krishna-Leela</br> (Krishna’s childhood). It was in this time, the dance moved away from the spirituality of the temple and</br> began to be influenced by folk elements.

    The word Kathakali literally means "Story-Play". Kathakali is a stylized classical Indian dance-drama noted for the</br> attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented</br> in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. In fact, the colorful and fascinating</br> costumes of Kathakali have become the most recognized icon of Kerala. Kathakali is considered as one of the most</br> magnificent theatres of imagination and creativity. It originated in the country's present day state of Kerala during</br> the 17th century and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides</br> more ornate singing and precise drumming. The themes of the Kathakali are religious in nature. They typically deal</br> with the Mahabarat, the Ramayana and the ancient scriptures known as the Puranas. This is performed in a text which</br> is generally Sanskritised Malayalam. The dancers wear large head dresses, and the different colours of the face are</br> extended with moulded lime. The extraordinary costumes and make-up transform the audience to a world of wonders.</br> The orchestra of a Kathakali performance includes two drums known as the chenda and the maddalam, along with </br>cymbals and another percussion instrument, the ela taalam. Normally, two singers provide the vocal accompaniment.</br> The style of singing particular to Kathakali is called Sopaanam. A traditional Kathakali performance begins in </br>the evening and continues throughout the night, when Good finally conquers Evil.

    Kuchipudi is an Indian classical dance originating in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India, but popular all over</br> South India. According to legend, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi founded the Kuchipudi dance-drama tradition. The</br> performance usually begins with stage rites. Then, each of the characters comes on the stage and introduces themselves with</br> a dharavu (a small composition of both song and dance.) The dharavu introduces the identity of the character and set the</br> mood. The drama then begins. The dance is accompanied by song, typically Carnatic music. The singer is accompanied by</br> mridangam, violin, flute and the tambura. Ornaments worn by the artists are generally made of a lightweight wood </br>called Boorugu. Kuchipudi dancers are quicksilver and scintillating, rounded and fleet-footed, they perform with grace</br> and fluid movements. In its solo exposition Kuchipudi numbers include 'jatiswaram' and 'tillana' whereas in nrityam it</br> has several lyrical compositions reflecting the desire of a devotee to merge with God. The graceful, lasya oriented</br> Kuchipudi gives importance to Vakyartha abhinaya go together. Certain movements are characteristic to Kuchipudi.</br> Vachika abhinaya (use of words/dialogues) is also a special feature of the Kuchipudi style. Most of the Karanas are often</br> used in Kuchipudi dance. Apart from six padabhedas, Kuchipudi dancers also use some traditional adavus :</br> Chaukam, Katteranatu, Kuppi Adugu, Ontaduvu,Jaraduvu, Pakkanatu. Like other classical dances, Kuchipudi also</br> comprises pure dance, mime and histrionics but it is the use of speech that distinguishes Kuchipudi's </br>presentation as dance drama.

   <p style="color:#800000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:38px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Manipuri dance is one of the major Indian classical dance forms. It originates from Manipur, a state in north-eastern India.</br> In Manipur, surrounded by mountains and geographically isolated at the meeting point of the orient and mainland India, the form</br> developed its own specific aesthetics, values, conventions and ethics. The cult of Radha and Krishna, particularly the raslila, is central</br> to its themes but the dances, unusually, incorporate the characteristic cymbals (kartal or manjira) and double-headed drum (pung or </br>Manipuri mridanga) of sankirtan into the visual performance. Manipuri dance is purely religious and its aim is a spiritual experience.</br> Development of music and dance has through religious festivals and daily activities of the Manipuri people. Manipuri dancers do not </br>wear ankle bells to accentuate the beats tapped out by the feet, in contrast with other Indian dance forms, and the dancers' feet never</br> strike the ground hard. Movements of the body and feet and facial expressions in Manipuri dance are subtle and aim at devotion and</br> grace. The traditional Manipuri dance style embodies delicate, lyrical and graceful movements. The aim is to make rounded movements and</br> avoid any jerks, sharp edges or straight lines. It is this which gives Manipuri dance its undulating and soft appearance. The dancer puts</br> his or her feet down, even during vigorous steps, with the balls of the feet touching the ground first. The dancer’s feet are neither put</br> down nor lifted up at the precise rhythmic points of the music but rather slightly earlier or later to express the same rhythmic points</br> most effectively. The lyrics used in Manipuri are usually from the classical poetry of Jayadeva, Vidyapati, Chandidas, Govindadas</br> or Gyandas and may be in Sanskrit, Maithili, Brij Bhasha or others. Not only is dance a medium of worship and enjoyment, a door to the </br>divine, but indispensable for all socio-cultural ceremonies. From the religious point of view and from the artistic angle of</br> vision, Manipuri classical form of dance is claimed not only to be one of the most chastest, modest, softest and mildest</br> but the most meaningful dances of the world.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#cc0000;">Mohiniyattam</h2>
   <p style="color:#800000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:38px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Mohiniyattam is a classical dance form from Kerala, India. It is considered a very graceful form of dance meant to be performed as</br> solo recitals by women. The term Mohiniyattam comes from the words "Mohini" meaning a woman who enchants onlookers and</br> "aattam" meaning graceful and sensuous body movements. The word "Mohiniyattam" literally means "dance of the enchantress".</br> The mythical lineage is explained with two stories of the Lord Vishnu disguised as a Mohini. In one, he appears as Mohini to lure </br>the asuras (demons) away from the amrita (nectar of immortality) obtained during the churning of the palazhi (ocean of milk and </br>salt water). In the second story Vishnu appears as Mohini to save Lord Shiva from the demon Bhasmasura. Guru Kallyanikutty Amma</br> cleared the mythical mystery behind the name of this dance form and gave it the most convincing explanation based on truth, social</br> and historical evolution, interpreting Mohiniyattam as the dance of a beautiful lady than that of a mythical enchantress from heaven.</br> It has elements of Koothu and Kottiyattom. Mohiniyattam is a drama in dance and verse. The dance involves the swaying of broad hips</br> and the gentle movements of erect posture from side to side. This is reminiscent of the swinging of the palm leaves and the gently</br> flowing rivers which abound Kerala, the land of Mohiniyattam. There are approximately 40 basic movements, known as atavukal.</br> The costume includes white sari embroidered with bright golden brocade (known as kasavu) at the edges. The dance follows the classical</br> text of Hastha Lakshanadeepika, which has elaborate description of mudras (gestural expressions by the hand palm and fingers).</br> The vocal music of Mohiniyattam involves variations in rhythmic structure known as chollu. The lyrics are in Manipravalam, a mixture</br> of Sanskrit and Malayalam. The Mohiniyattam dance is performed to this accompaniment by the subtle gestures and footwork of</br> the dancers. The performer uses the eyes in a very coy, sensual manner to enchant the mind without enticing the senses.

   <p style="font-size:18px; color:#990000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:36px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
     Odissi is originated from the state of Odisha, in eastern India. It is the oldest surviving dance form of India on the</br> basis of archaeological evidences. It was suppressed under the British Rule, but has been reconstructed since India</br> gained independence. It is particularly distinguished from other classical Indian dance forms by the importance it</br> places upon the Tribhangi (literally: three parts break), the independent movement of head, chest and pelvisand upon</br> the basic square stance known as Chauka or Chouka that symbolises Lord Jagannath. This dance is characterised</br> by various Bhangas (Stance), which involves stamping of the foot and striking various postures as seen in Indian</br> sculptures. The common Bhangas are Bhanga, Abanga, Atibhanga and Tribhanga. The best of traditional odissi</br> repertoire consists of abhinaya, an expressional dance which is an enactment of a song or poetry, where a story</br> conveyed to the audience through mudras (hand gestures), bhavas (facial expression), eye movement and body</br> movement. The dance is fluid, very graceful, and sensual. Abhinaya can be performed on verses in Sanskrit or Odia</br> language. The verses are extremely ornate in content and suggestion. Most common are Abhinayas on Oriya songs or</br> Sanskrit Ashthapadis or Sanskrit stutis like Dasavatar Stotram (depicting the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu) or</br> Ardhanari Stotram. Most of the Abhinaya compositions are based on the Radha-Krishna theme. The Astapadis of the</br> kãvya Gita Govinda written by the Saint Jayadev are an integral part of its repertoire. The beginning pieces are</br> dedicated to Lord Jagannath – an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The concluding item of a recital is Moksha which means</br> “spiritual liberation”. The dance moves onto a crescendo that is thrilling to both, the eye and the ear. With the </br>cosmic sound of the “Om”, the dance dissolves into nothingness — just like Moksha or the deliverance of the</br> soul in real life.

    Sattriya is one among the eight principal classical Indian dance traditions. Recognized in 2000 as a classical dance</br> by Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Sattriya is the most recent entrant in this list. The core of Sattriya Nritya has </br>usually been mythological stories. This was an artistic way of presenting mythological teachings to the people in </br>an accessible, immediate, and enjoyable manner. Sattriya Nritya is accompanied by musical compositions called</br> borgeets which are based on classical ragas. The instruments that accompany a traditional performance are khols</br> (drums), taals (cymbals) and the flute. Other instruments like the violin and the harmonium have been recent </br>additions. The costumes are usually made of pat – a silk produced in Assam which is derived from the mulberry plant</br> – and woven with intricate local motifs. There are two types of costumes: the male costume comprising the dhoti and </br>chadar and the female costume comprising the ghuri and chadar. The waist cloth which is known as the kanchi or</br> kingkini is worn by both the male and female dancers. The ornaments, too, are based on traditional Assamese design.</br> This dance form has remained a living tradition in Assam's Vaishnava monasteries, known as sattras, for over 500 years</br> now. It was originally practised by celibate monks in the form of mythological dance-dramas. These dance-dramas were,</br> in the main, written and directed by the Assamese Vaishnava saint and social reformer Sankaradeva, and by his</br> principal disciple Madhavadeva. Now that it has made its journey from the sanctified interiors of Assam's sattras to </br>the demotic spaces of the world's stages, it is time for an appraisal of Sattriya Nritya's artistic and aesthetic qualities.</br> Over the years, Sattriya Nritya has received greater acceptance and patronage both outside the state of Assam,</br> and outside India.

   <p style="font-size:15px; color:#b2b300; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; ">
     If political upheavals had threatened the art years ago, it is the idea of dance being a form of mere entertainment that is killing it today.</br> The declining audiences, the competition from popular cinema and TV and the influence of western culture only emphasizes the </br>lost sacredness of the dance. Tracing through the centuries of Indian dance one can only see it as being sacred or devotional.</br> Sage Bharata has noted in his colossal work that "Natya teaches duty to those who go against it, love to those who desire it, </br>chastises those who are ill-bred or unruly, promotes self restraint in those who are undisciplined, gives courage to the cowards,</br> enthusiasm to the valorous, enlightenment to those of poor intellect and gives wisdom to the learned.</br> It gives diversion to the kings, solace to those with a sorrowful mind, wealth to those desirous of it and composure to a mind of conflicts."</br> Today when moral values are declining and violence is increasing, it is the duty of the dancer to create an atmosphere of peace</br> through her dance and the deep spiritual dedication that accompanies any performer of the classical dance style.</br> After all, Brahma created this audio-visual art form to check the moral deterioration in the world.
