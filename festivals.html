   <h2 style="color:#990098">FESTIVAL</h2>
   <p style="color:#660065; font-weight:bold; line-height:44px; ">
    	Festival is the celebration of happiness and joy. Spreading the sense of unity and love</br> all around, it does not leave any strange feeling for each other. Every stranger 
        seems to be the</br> part of a family, wanting to be the part of collective one. It is the illumination of light</br> in darkness of despair, it is enlightenment of colours in environment of ignorance</br> and it is the message of spiritual significance wanting to communicate us the </br>language of history. Festival is like jumping into the pool of purity, letting ourselves</br> to wash out all our sorrows and feel the love of joy.

     A festival is celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community</br> and its religion or traditions. Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agriculture. Food is </br>such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and</br> thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn. Festivals often serve to</br> fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. The celebrations</br> offer a sense of belonging for religious, social, or geographical groups, contributing to group cohesiveness. </br>They may also provide entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the</br> advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform</br> community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a </br>means for unity among families. Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious </br>significance in traditional activities. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories </br>or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. There are numerous types of festivals</br> in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and</br> activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to "feasting") </br>and they bring people together.

   <p style="font-size:17px; color:#004c4d; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Being a highly spiritual country, festivals are at the heart of people’s lives in India. The numerous and varied festivals</br> that are held throughout the year offer a unique way of seeing Indian culture at its best. Uthsava or Utsav is derived</br> from the Sanskrit word, Utsava. The Sanskrit word Utsava comes from the word "ut" meaning "removal" and "sava" which</br> means "worldly sorrows" or "grief". A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting,</br> feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, Puja, Homa, aarti etc. Festivals are the periods of celebration and</br> are an important part of life of Indian people. When religion intervened to invest the festivals with spiritual meaning,</br> this joy came to be identified with the joy of worship. The harvesting festivals, the spring festivals, the sowing festivals,</br> during the rainy season are all associated with man’s relation with nature. The folk-culture behind these festivals has their</br> roots in the age-old folk-traditions and the impulses of the common man. Of course, as in primitive society social</br> relations corresponded simply with forces of production, the festivals then revealed the harmony of communal living </br>without any veils. Festivals, without class-hatred, bring the harmony in Indian society.

   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#804000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
     Diwali (or Deepavali, the "festival of lights") is an ancient Hindu festival which shares the belief that there is something beyond </br>the physical body and mind which is pure, infinite, and eternal, called the Atman. The celebration of Diwali as the "victory of good </br>over evil" refers to the light of higher knowledge dispelling all ignorance, the ignorance that masks one's true nature, not as the body,</br> but as the unchanging, infinite, immanent and transcendent reality. With this awakening comes compassion and the awareness of the</br> oneness of all things, and knowledge overcomes ignorance. Diwali is the celebration of this inner light over spiritual darkness, knowledge</br> over ignorance, right over wrong, good over evil. Hindus across the world celebrate Diwali in honor of the return of Lord Rama, his wife</br> Sita and his brother Lakshmana from exile of 14 years by his beloved mother Kaikayi, after Rama defeated Ravana. To honor the return</br> of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana from Lanka and to illuminate their path, villagers light Diyas to celebrate the triumph of good over</br> evil and his return. The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Purana to symbolically represent parts of sun, the cosmic giver of light and</br> energy to all life. Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops, outside doors and windows, around temples and </br>other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed. Before Diwali night, people clean, renovate, and decorate their</br> homes and offices. On Diwali night, Hindus dress up in new clothes or their best outfit, light up diyas inside and outside their home,</br> participate in family puja (prayers) to Lakshmi – the goddess of fertility and prosperity. After puja, fireworks follow, then a family feast </br>including mithai (sweets), and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#f6f5fa;">Holi</h2>
   <p style="font-size:19px; color:#ffffff; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Holi is a spring festival, also known as the festival of colours or the festival of sharing love. The festivities officially</br> usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love. There is a symbolic myth behind commemorating Krishna, a</br> Hindu diety. As a baby, Krishna developed his characteristic dark blue skin colour because the she-demon Putana </br>poisoned him with her breast milk. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha and other girls</br> would like him because of his skin colour. His mother, tired of the desperation, asks him to approach Radha and colour</br> her face in any colour he wanted. This he does, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. The Holi festival has further</br> cultural significance. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a</br> day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi celebrations</br> start on the night before Holi with a Holika bonfire where people gather, sing, dance and party. The next morning is a</br> free-for-all carnival of colours, where participants play, chase and colour each other with dry powder and coloured </br>water, with some carrying water guns and coloured water-filled balloons for their water fight. Anyone and everyone is</br> fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. Groups carry drums and other musical</br> instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. In the Braj region of North India, women have the option to </br>playfully hit men who save themselves with shields; for the day, men are culturally expected to accept whatever women</br> dish out to them. This ritual is called <strong>Lath Mar Holi</strong>.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#f6f5fa;">Onam</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#f6f5fa; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:15px; font-weight:bold;">
    Onam is a Hindu festival celebrated in Kerala. The festival marks the commemoration of Vamana avatara of Vishnu and the subsequent</br> homecoming of the mythical King Mahabali.  Kerala's rice harvest festival and the Festival of Rain Flowers, celebrates the Asura King</br> Mahabali's annual visit from Patala (the underworld).The King is so much attached to his kingdom that it is believed that he comes annually</br> from the nether world to see his people living happily. It is in honour of King Mahabali that Onam is celebrated. Onam mythology may</br> have been devised as a political tool where by the subjects could remind the rulers about an Ideal King and a welfare state.</br> Onam songs mentions many of the modern social/economic indicators of a Welfare State including Crime rates, Child Mortality rates etc.</br> Rulers may also have promoted it as it may have served as an indicator of the popularity of their Governance policies. The beauty of the </br>festival lies in its secular fabric. People of all religions, castes and communities celebrate the festival with equal joy and verve. Onam also</br> helps to create an atmosphere of peace and brotherhood by way of various team sports organised on the day. The floral carpet, known as</br> ‘Onapookkalam’,is made out of the gathered blossoms with several varieties of flowers of differing tints pinched up into little pieces to </br>serve the decorator's purpose. It is considered a work of art accomplished with a delicate touch and a highly artistic sense of tone and</br> blending. Traditional dance forms include Thiruvathirakali which is a women's dance performed in a circle around a lamp, and is given special </br>importance during Onam. Kummattikali is a famous and colorful-mask dance. The Vallamkali (the snake boat race) is another event that is</br> synonymous with Onam. Well-known races include the Aranmula Uthrattadhi Boat Race. About 100 oarsmen row huge and graceful snake boats</br> and men and women come from far and near to watch the snake boats skim through the water. People wear new clothes (Vastra) during Onam. </br>The 'Vastra' also stands for heart. Thus the significance of wearing new clothes is about making the heart new by removing all </br>bad thoughts and feelings.

   <p style="font-size:18px; color:#b35700; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:15px; font-weight:bold;">
    Vaisakhi, also known as Baisakhi, refers to the harvest festival of the Punjab region, India. This day is observed as a </br>thanksgiving day by farmers whereby farmers pay their tribute, thanking God for the abundant harvest and also</br> praying for future prosperity. A tradition associated with harvesting is Aawat pauni which involves people getting </br>together to harvest the wheat. Drums are played whilst people work. At the end of the day, people sing dohay to the</br> tunes of the drum. The harvest festival is also characterised by the folk dance Bhangra which traditionally is a harvest</br> dance. The festival bears a great significance for Sikhs because on the Vaisakhi Day 13 April in the year 1699, the 10th</br> Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh laid down the foundation of the Panth Khalsa, that is the Order of the Pure Ones </br>giving rise to the festival of Khalsa Sirjana Divas. It is also used as a celebration for those accepting the five Ks. To</br> mark the celebrations, Sikh devotees generally attend the Gurdwara before dawn with flowers and offerings in hands. The</br> first day of Vaisakh is celebrated as Mesha Sankranti which marks the solar new year and is celebrated by Hindus by </br>bathing in sacred rivers. Vaisakhi almost coincides with the festival of 'Vishu' celebrated in Kerala a day after Vaisakhi.</br> The festivities include fireworks, shopping for new clothes and interesting displays called 'Vishu Kani'. These are </br>arrangements of flowers, grains, fruits, cloth, gold, and money are viewed early in the morning, to ensure a year of </br>prosperity. The other festival Vaisakhi almost coincides with is Bohag Bihu which is celebrated in Assam a day after </br>Vaisakhi where the community organizes massive feasts, music, and dancing. Being a seasonal dance, traditional</br> Bhangra is practiced in the month leading up to the festival of Vaisakhi. Local fairs mark the festival of Vaisakhi.</br> After days of harvesting and at Vaisakhi fairs, Bhangra is performed, as a dance of men alone.

   <p style="font-size:18px; color:#0070e6; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:15px; font-weight:bold;">
    Krishna Janmashtami, also known as Krishnashtami, is an annual celebration of the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna,</br> the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Rasa lila, dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna, are a special feature in regions of </br>Mathura and Vrindavan. While the Rasa lila re-creates the flirtatious aspects of Krishna's youthful days, the Dahi Handi</br> celebrate God's playful and mischievous side, where teams of young men form human towers to reach a high-hanging pot of </br>butter and break it. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, worshipping Krishna and staying up until midnight, the time </br>when Krishna is believed to have been born. Images of Krishna's infancy are placed in swings and cradles in temples and </br>homes. At midnight, devotees gather around for devotional songs, dance and exchange gifts. Some temples also conduct</br> readings of the Hindu religious scripture Bhagavad Gita. Dahi Handi is celebrated as an event which involves making a </br>human pyramid and breaking an earthen pot (handi) filled with buttermilk (dahi), which is tied at a convenient height. </br>The topmost person tries to break the handi by hitting it with a blunt object. When the handi breaks, the buttermilk is </br>spilled over the entire group. This event is based on the legend of the child-god Krishna stealing butter. A participant in </br>this festival is called Govinda. Places in Uttar Pradesh that are associated with Krishna's childhood, such as Mathura, </br>Gokul and Vrindavan, attract visitors from all over India, who go there to participate in the festival celebrations. People </br>in the city of Dwarka in Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his Kingdom – celebrate the festival </br>by visiting the Dwarkadhish temple. In Jammu, kite flying is an important part of the celebration on this day. The next</br> day is called "Nanda Utsav" or the joyous celebration of Krishna's foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. On this day,</br> people break their fast and offer various sweets during the early hours.

    Navaratri is a festival dedicated to the worship of the Hindu deity Durga. The word Navaratri means 'nine nights'</br> in Sanskrit. During these nine nights and ten days, nine forms of Devi are worshipped. The beginning of spring and the </br>beginning of autumn are considered to be important junctions of climatic and solar influences. These two periods are </br>taken as sacred opportunities for the worship of the Divine Mother Durga. Navaratri or Navadurga Parva happens to be </br>the most auspicious and unique period of devotional sadhanas and worship of Shakti (the sublime, ultimate, absolute </br>creative energy) of the Divine conceptualized as the Mother Goddess-Durga. In the Vedic Age of the Indian Culture,</br> the religious philosophy and devotional practices were focused towards true knowledge and ultimate realization of the </br>supreme power of Gayatri (Bram Shakti). The Vedas were the basis of all streams of spirituality and science those days.</br> Gayatri has been the source of the divine powers of the gods and goddesses in the heavens and their angelic</br> manifestations and incarnations. Navaratri is celebrated in different ways throughout India. In North India, all three </br>Navaratris are celebrated with much fervor by fasting on all nine days and worshiping the Mother Goddess in her </br>different forms. Another prevalent practice is of sowing pulses, cereals and other seeds on the first day of this festival </br>in a pot which is watered for nine days at the end of which the seeds sprout. This custom is also indicative of</br> fertility worship and is known as "Khetri". In Western India, particularly in the state of Gujarat and Mumbai,</br> Navaratri is celebrated with the famous Garba and Dandiya-Raas dance.
