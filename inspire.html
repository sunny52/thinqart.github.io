	 <p style="color:#3398ff; line-height:40px; padding-top:20px; font-size:15px;">In ancient times, India had the Gurukula system of education in which anyone who wished to study went to a teacher's (Guru) house and requested to be taught. If accepted as a student by the guru, he would then stay at the guru's place and help in all activities at home. This not only created a strong tie between the teacher and the student, but also taught the student everything about running a house. The student stayed as long as he wished or until the guru felt that he had taught everything he could teach. All learning was closely linked to nature and to life, and not confined to memorizing some information.

   <p style="font-size:15px; color:#eb6062; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:30px;">
    Rote learning  plagues our system, students study only to score marks in exams,</br> and sometimes to crack exams. Knowledge is largely forgotten after the semester exam is over.</br> Still, year after year Indian students are focused on cramming information. The colonial masters introduced education systems</br> in India to create clerks and accountants, and we have not deviated much from that pattern till today.</br> If once the youngsters prepared en masse for civil services and bank officers exams, they now prepare to become engineers.</br> Nowadays, everyone wants to be a doctor, engineer, collector or management executive.</br> If there are a few centres of educational excellence, for each of those there are thousands of mediocre</br> and terrible schools, colleges and now even universities that do not</br> meet even minimum standards of purpose of education. If things have changed</br> a little bit somewhere, elsewhere things have sunk into further inertia,</br> corruption and lack of ambition.

   <p style="padding-top:30px;">
    We also live in a country where the people see other creative activities of no use.</br> Is it not the part of education. If the education system is </br>failing- then it is certainly not due to lack of demand for education</br> of creative things, but because market for its education does not exist.

    Creating a few more schools or allowing hundreds of colleges and private universities to mushroom,</br> in which government is spending billions of rupees, is not going to solve the crisis of education in India.</br> Children are already been put into mind-numbing and creativity killing barter exchange system of marks.</br> And a crisis it is- we are in a country where people are spending their parent's life savings</br> and borrowed money on stucked courses - and even after getting standard education in that, struggle to find employment of their choice.</br> In this country, millions of students are victim of an unrealistic, pointless, mindless rat race.</br> The mind aching competiton and rote learning do not only crush the creativity and originality</br> of millions of Indian students every year, it also drives brilliant students to commit suicide.

   <h4>Exploring beauty of various works</h4>
   <p>Education is the imagination of colors seen in the window of paper for an artist.</br> It is the lyrics of a song combined with music for a singer.</br>  It is the needle and thread, the indispensable tools for doing embroidery to a designer.</br> It is the craft of words to plot a story for a writer.</br> It is the movement of body parts for a dancer.</br>It is the smell and taste of various dishes for a cook.</br> Education is poetry of words to explain sensible feelings of the poet.</br>Education is the knowledge packed in code for a programmer.</br>

    <h4 style="padding-top:20px;">Reward creativity and original thinking
	</h4>
	<p style="color:#ffffff;">Our education system rarely rewards what deserves highest academic accolades. Deviance is discouraged. Risk taking is mocked. Our testing and marking systems need to be built to recognize original contributions, in form of creativity, problem solving, valuable original research and innovation. Memorising is no learning; the biggest flaw in our education system is perhaps that it incentivizes memorizing </br>and cramming above originality.

   <h2>Education of Values</h2>
   <p>
    Education with learning of values and morals can make children grow spiritually and the new generation can make this world a peaceful</br> place to live. There are two main approaches to values education, it can be inculcating or transmitting a set of values which often come</br> from societal or religious rules or cultural ethics, or it can be of Socratic dialogue where people are gradually</br> brought to their own realisation of what is good behaviours for themselves and their community. </br>
	Themes that values education can address to varying degrees are character, moral development, religious Education,</br> spiritual development, citizenship education, personal development, social development and cultural development.</br>
	While both mental and physical development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar – that of</br> emotional intelligence and morality – to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice,</br> Jeevan Vigyan draws on the findings of various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences. Our parasympathetic</br> nervous system and endocrinal system are known to be the drivers of our emotions and our behavior.

   <h2>VISION FOR EDUCATION</h2>
   <p>Seeing a ten year old kid playing 'Knockin’ on heavens door' on guitar.</br> Watching a twelve year old kid performing Bharatnatyam on stage.</br> Listening to a sixteen year old kid reciting a poem and a eighteen year old </br> being a socially motivated kid and going to change the world.</br> We think that THINQART is going to be the stage on which </br>you can see the heart moving performances</br> and motivate yourself to help us cure education.
