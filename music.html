     Classical music ultimately emphasizes clarity with a more concise melodic expression and creates</br> instrumental color. This genre of music allows the composer to combine poetry, talent, and expressionism </br>and brings together a plethora of instruments to create classical music. The melody comes together very </br>clearly using little expression, while keeping a wonderful quality in tone or timbre. The melodic expression</br> is virtually a form of the composer's emotions wrapped into one piece of music. The composer writes the </br>music using a group of instruments to create one particular sound. Each instrument creates a certain sound,</br> making each sound distinguishable from each other, and when combined, creates the melodic expression.</br> The music is poetically a form of expression that tells a story to the listener. An opera designates the</br> composer's music into a musical story. The music creates a mood, and the characters vocalize in succession</br> with the music creating the scene. Melodic expression has a variety of sounds, which conjoin, and create</br> a single and harmonic piece of music. Instrumental color creates the music's quality. Classical music</br> entails concise melodic expression, which comes from the composers emotions and the instrumental color</br> comes from the conductor's rhythmic conduction and the timbre of the orchestra.

   <p style="font-size:20px; color:#b35800; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:48px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Indian Classical Music is probably the most ancient form of world music and it dates back to Vedic </br>Age. Indian classical music is the art music of the Indian subcontinent. It has been</br> significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. Bharat's Natyashastra was the first </br>treatise laying down fundamental principles of dance, music, and drama. Indian classical music is both</br> elaborate and expressive. Hindus believe that the creation was started with an indistinct sound which</br> later manifests itself as a two note sound, OM( It originates from the tonal frequency and eventually rises</br> upto the perfect fourth.) and then everything happened from that divine sound. This itself proves how old</br> the connection of music was with the Vedic civilisation. Indian classical music is monophonic in nature and </br>based on a single melody line, which is played over a fixed drone. The performance is based melodically</br> on particular ragas and rhythmically on talas.

   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#800000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:44px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Hindustani music is mainly found in North India. Khyal and Dhrupad are its two main forms, but there are several other classical</br> and semi-classical forms. There is an amount of foreign influences in Hindustani music in terms of the instruments, style of presentation,</br> and ragas such as Hijaz Bhairav, Bhairavi, Bahar, and Yaman. Hindustani music has assimilated various folk tunes. For example, ragas </br>such as Kafi and Jaijaiwanti are based on folk tunes. Players of the tabla, a type of drum, usually keep the rhythm, an indicator of</br> time in Hindustani music. Another common instrument is the stringed tanpura, which is played at a steady tone throughout the </br>performance of the raga, and which provides both a point of reference for the musician and a background against which the music</br> stands out. The task of playing the tanpura traditionally falls to a student of the soloist. Other instruments for accompaniment include</br> the sarangi and the harmonium. The performance usually begins with a slow elaboration of the raga, known as alap. This may be very </br>short (less than a minute) or up to 30 minutes depending on the preference of the musician. In vocal music, the alap is followed </br>by a bandish, generally accompanied by the tabla, around which the raga is improvised. In the case of instrumental music, the alap could</br> be followed by a more rhythmical piece known as "jod" in which the artist provides rhythm with no rhythmic cycle, and subsequently</br> a piece in fast tempo called "jhala". The counterpart of the bandish in instrumental music is known as the "gat". The bandish or gat</br> is initially sung or played in slow tempo known as "vilambit laya" to be followed by medium tempo known as "madhya laya" which in</br> turn may be followed by a composition in fast tempo known as "drut gat".

    Khyal is the modern genre of classical singing in North India. Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning "imagination". Like all </br>Indian classical music, khyal is modal, with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts. The modes are called raga, and each raga is</br> a complicated framework of melodic rules. Khyal bases itself on a repertoire of short songs (two to eight lines); a khyal song is called </br>a bandish. Every singer generally renders the same bandish differently, with only the text and the raga remaining the same. Khyal</br> bandishes are typically composed in a variant of Urdu/Hindi, and sometimes in Marathi or Punjabi, and these compositions cover diverse</br> topics, such as romantic or divine love, praise of kings or gods, the seasons, dawn and dusk, and the pranks of Krishna, and they can</br> have symbolism and imagery. The bandish is divided into two parts — the sthayi (or asthayi) and the antara, with the former considered</br> more important as it shows the melodic contours of the raga. The sthayi often uses notes from the lower octave and the lower half</br> of the middle octave, while the antara ascends to the tonic of the upper octave and beyond before descending and linking back to the</br> sthayi. The singer uses the composition as raw material for improvisation, accompanied by a harmonium or bowed string instrument</br> such as the sarangi or violin playing off the singer's melody line, a set of two hand drums (the tabla), and a drone in the background. </br>The role of the accompanist playing the melody-producing instrument is to provide continuity when the singer pauses for breath, using </br>small variations of the singer's phrases or parts thereof. While there is a wide variety of rhythmic patterns that could be used by</br> the percussionist, khyal performances typically use Ektaal, Jhoomra, Jhaptaal, Tilwada, Tintal, Rupak, and Adachautaal.

  <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#330000;">Dhrupad</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#4d3d00; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:44px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Dhrupad is a vocal genre in Hindustani classical music, said to be the oldest still in use in that musical tradition. Its name is derived</br> from the words dhruva and pad (verse), where a part of the poem (dhruv) is used as a refrain. The term may denote both the verse form</br> of the poetry and the style in which it is sung. Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual (mostly in praise of Hindu deities) </br>to royal panegyrics, musicology and romance. Dhrupad is performed by a solo singer or a small number of singers in unison to the beat</br> of the pakhavaj or mridang rather than the tabla. The vocalist is usually accompanied by two tanpuras. Dhrupad styles have long elaborate</br> alaps, their slow and deliberate melodic development gradually bringing an accelerating rhythmic pulse. The composition is sung to the</br> rhythmic accompaniment: the four lines, are termed sthayi, antara, sanchari and aabhog. There are said to be four broad stylistic variants</br> (vanis or banis) of classical dhrupad – the Gauri (Gohar), Khandar, Nauhar, and Dagar, tentatively linked to five singing styles (geetis)</br> known from the 7th Century: Shuddha, Bhinna, Gauri, Vegswara, and Sadharani. More importantly, there are a number of dhrupad gharanas:</br> "houses", or family styles. The best-known gharana is the Dagar family  who sing in the Dagar vani. The Dagar style puts great emphasis on</br> alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs. The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindu texts of Gods and</br> Goddesses. From the state of Bihar come two other gharanas, the Malliks (Darbhanga gharana) and the Mishras (Bettiah gharana).</br> The Malliks are linked to the Khandar vani and Gauharvani, they emphasize the Ragaalap as well as the composed song over an improvised</br> alap with a variety of layakaris and thihayees. The Mishras practise both Nauhar and Khandar styles with some unique techniques for</br> nomtom alap. This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of Bettiah Raj.

    Carnatic music, from South India, tends to be more rhythmically intensive and structured than</br> Hindustani music. Examples of this are the logical classification of ragas into melakarthas, and the use of</br> fixed compositions similar to Western classical music. Carnatic raga elaborations are generally much faster </br>in tempo and shorter than their equivalents in Hindustani music. In addition, accompanists have a much larger</br> role in Carnatic concerts than in Hindustani concerts. A devotion and a request for a blessing follows, then </br>a series of interchanges between ragams (unmetered melody) and thaalams (the ornamentation, equivalent to </br>the jor). This is intermixed with hymns called krithis. The pallavi or theme from the raga then follows.</br> Carnatic pieces also have notated lyrical poems that are reproduced as such, possibly with embellishments</br> and treatments according to the performer's ideology. Primary themes include worship, descriptions of</br> temples, philosophy, and nayaka-nayika (Sanskrit "hero-heroine") themes. Tyagaraja (1759–1847),</br> Muthuswami Dikshitar (1776–1827) and Syama Sastri (1762–1827) are known as the Trinity of Carnatic music,</br> while Purandara Dasa (1480–1564) is considered the father of Carnatic music. Instruments typically used</br> in Carnatic music include venu, gottuvadyam, harmonium, veena, mridangam, kanjira, ghatam and violin.

     Why are people losing interest in pure classical music? It is not only a problem in India but also the whole world right now. </br>Any form of 'classical' music (Western or Indian) needs a totally different intellectual and spiritual makeup - a mental discipline and a</br> relatively quiet mind are prerequisites to appreciate such profound music. Unfortunately, we are surrounded by incredible amount </br>of noise and slowly losing the ability to appreciate any form of classical art. Classical music has faded away from public consciousness</br> as the pre-eminent musical expression of the country. Classical music has stopped being the aspirational form of music for</br> vast sections of India’s youth. Reason being that classical music (like most hereditary art forms in India) was</br> (and still is) essentially casteist, especially in the South. Their are only certain communities, or worse certain very specific families </br>in the community who held the secrets of the particular Gharana and the intricacies of their specific interpretations of the ragas. </br>Limited educational sources also adds to its difficulty for survival.

   <h4>Importance of Music Education</h4>
   <p>
    What would life be like without pure music? Imagine it for a moment. Eventually, no one would even remember what classical music is. Many</br> people do not realize it, but this  music has a bigger effect on their lives than they may think, and they would definitely care if it was to disappear.</br> To keep classical music alive, students must be educated about it in schools. Students will not only get to experience and enjoy what music has to</br> offer, but will reap the innumerable benefits that come with music. It is the most emotionally and intellectually fulfilling’ thing a child can do. </br>The educational benefits of performing are undeniable: focus, team work, listening and non-verbal communication, just for starters. They can be </br>taught how to play an instrument, while needlessly sidelining the lessons in history, poetry, philosophy, expression and language that classical music has</br> to offer. Teaching kids to love classical music can only be done by teaching them how to listen to the music. Let them obsess by listening on repeat</br> (in that special way that only kids can do), inventing stories, dancing around. Ancient Greek philosopher and teacher Plato said it best:</br> “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to imagination, and life to everything.”
