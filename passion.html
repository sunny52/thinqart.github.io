   <p style="color:#00aaff; font-weight:bold; line-height:44px; ">
    An aptitude is a component of a competency to do a certain kind of work at an</br> uncertain level, which can also be considered as "talent". Talent is not inherited, but a gift </br>from supreme soul which gets nourished on an ample diet of inspiration and desire</br> to do something great with it. Skill is substitute of it, success is the by-product of it; </br>difficulties are indispensable partner of it and passion is the wife of it. </br>Use of it leads to better and most important, a happy life.

    Voltaire once thought that people of all cultures and religions should not only be tolerated</br> but embraced as part of a greater brotherhood of man. Such ideas were quickly absorbed</br> into the music. Great artists sought to rid musical expression of "useless, excessive ornamentation"</br> and draw from the ideals of "simplicity, truth and naturalness" in their music. Indeed,</br> Music is the greatest creation of man, which touches the soul and also helps man</br> to sympathetically manifest unspoken desire and humanity in him. But music is idle if</br> not come out from the tunes which sings the imagination of a musician. It is not that everybody</br> can understand the beauty of music but everyone can be drawn towards it. Music only needs</br> great artists, composers and musicians who can spread the message of its greatness, </br>smell of its purity and melody of its tunes in the whole world around. How can this beautiful purpose</br> be useless and how can be the crazy creators of it be mad!

    Dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the </br>purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.</br> Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something</br> that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These</br> two concepts of the art of dance — dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art; are</br> the two most important connecting ideas running through the subject. The transcendence of dance is also </br>experienced by the spectators. Drawn into the rhythms and patterns created by the dancer’s movements, they</br> begin to share in the emotions being expressed through them. The awareness of the body through sensations in</br> the joints and muscles, rather than through visual perception, not only defines the dancer’s experience of his</br> own body in movement but also the way in which dance exerts its power over the spectators, who not only see it</br> but also feel an echo of the dancer’s movements and rhythms in their own nerve endings. We can imagine what</br> happiness it gives to the dancers and spectators as well.

   <p style="font-size:20px; color:#7f8000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:44px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Photography is the beauty of vision and how it sees the world. Photographers design their own vision to see</br> things and do not depend on how things meant to be. Some passionable photographers used to go on various</br> places, places undiscovered and untreaded, and figure out something which deserves to be captured and present </br>it which can be seen in magazines or internet. It is a way of telling people about the hidden beauty of things </br>which can be seen through a very different perspective and can be understood through a very different thinking.</br> Photography is something which doesn't need any talent, techniques or methods; one just only need an </br>art of observation and a highly professional camera. It, of course, is mandatory for great pictures.</br> People use to collect their memories in the form of photographs and rewind their times of childhood, friendship,</br> lovely times, times spend with family by seeing the photographs. They all use to tell a story of particular part </br>of life and people often gets overjoy, becomes sad and cry. Great artists travel whole around the world,</br> meet people, share stories and take photographs to explain it to the world. </br>It keeps those moments alive, isn't it.

    Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through </br>the inscription of words. The result of writing is generally called text, and the </br>recipient of text is called a reader, but the maker of it is known as writer. Motivations for writing</br> include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in</br> keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the</br> formation of legal systems. It is also an important medium of expressing oneself by way of written words </br>as do authors, poets and the like. The most important and the most beautiful results out of </br>peoples' creative thinking are novels and poems. Some literary creative writers write such an</br> amazing stories which inspire people to adhere it. Poems are beautiful and do have </br>emotionally compelling purpose to infect human heart with love and enlightenment. A writer writes </br>to inspire many, but founds his inspiration in loneliness,</br> just thinking and imagining.

   <p style="font-size:20px; color:#007f80; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:44px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
     Designing is brainstorming of imagination spread in colorful ideas and apply on the thing</br> wherever it suits. Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic </br>and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It is a roadmap or a </br>strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans,</br> parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social,</br> environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective. Reflections on material culture</br> and environmental concerns guide a design philosophy. A designer have to be imaginative, always got drunk</br> by the wine of creative thinking. The great designs in the form of architecture, interior, graphic,</br> painting, handicrafts, artifacts and sculptures explains that master needs patience and creativity needs</br> constant appetite of inspiration and thinking. There is no better field other than designing to test</br> patience and power of imagination.

      Sports are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which, through casual </br>or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing</br> enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. It was man’s desire</br> for a healthy pastime and a method of self evaluation and competition that gave birth to sports.</br> Sports keeps the sense of joyment and spirit alive in players as well as spectators.</br> There is shouting, tense, roar, inspiration in whole over the stadium. Besides joy, sports have countless</br> health and physical benefits. Facts are not able to make that much mark on youngsters' minds</br> as sports have made. It is the rescuer from boring hours of rote learning and create boundless openness</br> to strive for enjoyment and play. It raise team spirit, sense to give best without caring </br>of result and hunger to reach the goal without giving harm to others. These are the basic skills </br>that a player is crafted with, spiritually.

    Mozart playing 'Die Zauberflöte', Rukmini Devi Arundale performing 'Bharatnatyam', Tagore reciting</br> 'Geetanjali'and Tolstoy writing 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You'; Einstein lecturing 'General Relativity',</br> Darwin beautifully explaining 'The Origin of Species', Newton describing 'Gravity' and Leonardo Da Vinci</br> painting 'The Last supper'. Each of these individuals possess something we call 'talent'. Every great genius,</br> passing through the rough seas of mediocre minds' thoughts, was able to figure out where his or her heart lies</br> and what talent that heart possessed. Educational facts and knowledge of educational bodies didn't seem to</br> make an impressionable mark on their life and not even confine thinking in boundaries of four walls was able</br> to bring out any genius from them. For them, there was one road cemented with the interest they have. Only </br>thing required was to just move on to that path, face difficulties and reach the point which would permanently</br> change the way that humanity perceived the world. Their passion to do something with their interests is</br> what driven them. But not everyone in the world is as mighty and lucky to have wings to fly away from the</br> cage of predefined way of living life and suffer the brutality of lashes of narrow thinking. Everyone has a</br> passion of his own and one do figure it out in the due course of life, but question still remains what </br>he ends up doing with it.
