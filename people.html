   <h2 style="color:#b300af">GREAT PEOPLE</h2>
   <p style="color:#660064; font-weight:bold; line-height:44px; ">
    We know the success of great people who changed the world. But most probably</br> we undermine the struggles they had been through, hardships they encountered </br>and change they felt every day. Great People never lived for themselves,</br> but for the community they want to serve, an idea they want to live and for the higher purpose</br> they have been assigned for. Far away from normal course of life</br> they intended to design their own paths and let those paths</br> become inspiration for millions to come.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#4a4d00;">Rumini Devi Arundale</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#181a00; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Rukmini Devi Arundale was an Indian theosophist, dancer and choreographer of the Indian classical dance form of Bharatnatyam, and an</br> activist for animal rights and welfare. She is considered the most important revivalist in the Indian classical dance form of Bharatnatyam from</br> its original 'sadhir' style, prevalent amongst the temple dancers and she also worked for the re-establishment of traditional Indian arts and</br> crafts. Though she belonged to the Indian upper-caste she espoused the cause of Bharata Natyam, which was considered a low and vulgar art</br> in the early 1920s. Recognising the beauty and the spiritual value of this art form, she not only learned the dance, but also presented it on stage</br> despite strong public protests. In 1933, she saw for the first time, a performance of the dance form called 'Sadhir'. Later she learnt the dance</br> from 'Mylapore Gowri Amma', and finally with help of E Krishna Iyer from 'Pandanallur Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai'. In 1935, Rukmini Devi </br>gave her first public performance at the 'Diamond Jubilee Convention of the Theosophical Society'. Originally known as sadhir, the Indian </br>classical dance form of Bharatnatyam owes its current name, to E Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale, who has been instrumental in </br>modifying mainly the Pandanallur style of Bharatanatyam and bringing it to the global attention. Soon she changed the very face of the dance,</br> by introducing musical instruments, like violin, set and lighting design elements, and innovative costumes, and jewellery inspired by the temple</br> sculptures. The lesson to learnt here is that one has to see where one’s spontaneous inclination lies and then have the courage</br> and conviction to back it up.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#006566;">Helen Keller</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#003233; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    At a plain, black well-pump in the small southern town of Tuscumbia, Alabama, one of the world's great miracles took place. It began one bright,</br> spring day in 1887. Puffy white clouds floated overhead on a background of blue, while birds fluttered through oaks and maples and flowers</br> burst forth from the fertile soil in an array of colors—all unheard and unseen by a pretty girl of seven. Helen Keller was an American author,</br> political activist, and lecturer. She was the first deafblind person to earn a bachelor of arts degree. A member of the Socialist Party of America </br>and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned for women's suffrage, labor rights, socialism, and other similar causes. There is </br>one speech of her which immensely touched our heart. Her words could be summed up this way: 'My teacher told you how her one word touched </br>the darkness of my mind and how I woke up to the bliss of life. I was dumb; now I can speak. I am obliged to the hands and hearts of others for</br> this achievement. Through their love I came to see my mind; I could see God, I could find happiness. In fact, we all live for helping others </br>and for being helped. By remaining united we can do a lot of things. Only love can break down the walls that stand between us and our happiness.</br> The greatest commandment is to love one another. I would like to thank God at the top of my voice for all the love, happiness and hope that</br> would be coming to me.' Helen demanded humanitarian consideration and equality for the disabled people. Even today, the life of Helen</br> who successfully conquered obstacles in life is indeed a source of inspiration and zeal for millions of people. The eventful life of her</br> has ever been an inspiration for the physically disabled and for those who suffer discrimination of any kind.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#800000;">Sudha Chandran</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#330000; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    What happens when the thing you want most, is the one thing you can’t have. Most of us will be heartbroken or get depressed. But not Sudha</br> Chandran. Sudha Chandran is an accomplished bharatanatyam dancer, Indian film and television actress. In June 1981, while travelling in Tamil</br> Nadu, she met with an accident in which her legs were wounded. She received initial medical treatment of her injuries at a local hospital and was</br> later admitted to Vijaya Hospital at Madras. After doctors discovered that gangrene had formed on her right leg, amputation was required. </br>Chandran says that this period was the toughest time of her life. She subsequently overcame her disability with the help of a prosthetic </br>'Jaipur foot', becoming one of the most highly acclaimed dancers of the Indian subcontinent. Here is from her blog post: 'Finally one day,</br>I went to my dad and told him that I was ready to perform again... and he was shocked! I was to perform in St.Xaviers college on Sunday when </br>the Sunday morning headline read – ‘Looses a Foot, Walks a Mile’ and the show was completely sold out! I began to get nervous before going up</br> on stage when my Grandmother told me, 'Don’t worry, God is with you…let the miracle happen.' but I was so angry that I said, 'If God was with</br> me he wouldn’t ever do this to me!' Believe it or not, the show ended, I performed the Varanyam with ease and received a standing ovation. </br>It was after that, that I received so much respect from the media, got an offer to act in a film based on my life and received all of the </br>opportunities that I have today. What my grandmother said was true — God was with me. Even if I didn’t see it then, he was with me all along</br> and that’s the irony of life — that an accident so fatal, can still be a blessing in disguise.'

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#660021;">Oprah Winfrey</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#330011; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Being allegedly molested during her childhood and working as a maid, who can imagine her struggles and find out her being the richest</br> self made woman of America. Oprah Winfrey is an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist. She is best</br> known for her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show, which was the highest-rated program of its kind in history. Dubbed the "Queen of All Media",</br> she has been ranked the richest African-American of the 20th century, the greatest black philanthropist in American history, and is currently</br> North America's first and only multi-billionaire black person. Several assessments regard her as the most influential woman in the world.</br> Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in an inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood.</br> She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14; her son died in infancy. Sent to live </br>with the man she calls her father, a barber in Tennessee, Winfrey landed a job in radio while still in high school and began co-anchoring the</br> local evening news at the age of 19. Her emotional ad-lib delivery eventually got her transferred to the daytime-talk-show arena, and after</br> boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company and became internationally syndicated.</br> By the mid-1990s she had reinvented her show with a focus on literature, self-improvement, and spirituality. Though criticized for unleashing</br> a confession culture, promoting controversial self-help ideas, and an emotion-centered approach, she is often praised for overcoming adversity</br> to become a benefactor to others.

   <h2 style="padding-top:15px; color:#993d00;">Malala Yousafzai</h2>
   <p style="font-size:16px; color:#4d1e00; letter-spacing:0.16em; line-height:40px; text-align:center; padding-top:20px; font-weight:bold;">
    Shot in head for the right of education for all those girls who are deprived of it. Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora,</br> the largest city in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. She is the daughter of Ziauddin and Tor Pekai Yousafzai and has two younger brothers. At a very</br> young age, Malala developed a thirst for knowledge. For years her father, a passionate education advocate himself, ran a learning institution </br>in the city, and school was a big part of her family. She later wrote that her father told her stories about how she would toddle into classes</br> even before she could talk and acted as if she were the teacher. In 2007, when she was ten years old, the Taliban began to control the</br> Swat Valley, girls were banned from attending school and the group made its opposition to a proper education for girls a cornerstone of its </br>terror campaign. Determined to go to school and with a firm belief in her right to an education, she stood up to the Taliban. Alongside her father,</br> she quickly became a critic of their tactics. "How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?" she once said on Pakistani TV.</br> On the morning of October 9, 2012, 15-year-old  was shot by the Taliban. Today, the Malala Fund has become an organization that, </br>through education, empowers girls to achieve their potential and become confident and strong leader in their own countries. Currently residing</br> in Birmingham, she is an active proponent of education as a fundamental social and economic right. Through her own voice, she remains</br> a staunch advocate for the power of education and for girls to become agents of change in their communities.

    For six days, he kept himself alive with fierce self-control and a conviction that only logical thought could let him survive. But the epiphany</br> when the 27-year-old climber realised how he could save his own life came from an explosion of blind rage. Aron Ralston is an American</br> outdoorsman, engineer and motivational speaker. He survived a canyoneering accident in southeastern Utah in 2003, during which he amputated</br> his own right forearm with a dull pocketknife in order to extricate himself from a dislodged boulder, which had him trapped in Blue John Canyon </br>for five days and seven hours. After he freed himself, he had to make his way through the remainder of the canyon, then rappel down a 65-foot</br> sheer cliff face in order to reach safety. Later, his severed hand and forearm were retrieved from under the boulder by park authorities.</br> According to television presenter, it took 13 men, a winch and a hydraulic jack to move the boulder so that Ralston's arm could be removed.</br> His arm was then cremated and the ashes were given to him. He returned to the accident scene six months later on his 28th birthday to film a</br> Dateline NBC special about the accident and to scatter the ashes of his arm where he said they belong. After the accident occurred, Ralston </br>continued to climb mountains frequently, including participating in a 2008 expedition to climb Ojos del Salado in Chile and Monte Pissis in </br>Argentina. In 2005, Ralston became the first person to climb all 59 named Colorado's 'fourteeners' solo in winter, a project he started in 1997</br> and resumed after the amputation in Blue John Canyon. Of the authenticity of 127 Hours, Ralston has said that the film is "so factually accurate </br>it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama", and he satirically added that he thought it is "the best film ever made."

    We can't apply every lesson we learn from struggles and hardships of great people voluntarily in our life.</br> But each lesson learnt can help us finding solution to a particular circumstance and it can help us to get out of it.</br> They inspire us to do something great when we search for our true potential, they give us hope that help always</br> comes in times of difficulties and success do come to those who do have a plan and idea for millions to benefit.</br> It have taken some going through physical hardships, mental problems, family affairs and criticizm but beside</br> that they rose and fulfilled their destiny. Success not always kiss everyones' cheek because of certain </br>circumstances or that they never get a chance to fight narrow minded society they are surrounded with and fly</br> to open minded people who can uplift their talent. It takes courage to move, hard work to move faster and will</br> to run but all these need belief, care and trust of someone who can give support as a companion, as a friend.</br> It was always with great people that there was always somebody behind their success, whether it is Anne Sullivan</br> for Helen Keller, her father for Malala and God for everyone. Thinqart is just that one step to revive that</br> 'somebody for someone' relation and giving every young lad his or her companion. Making young talents great</br> and present them on the world stage, this is the vision of ours.
